        <h2>One of my favorite games to play right now is Hades 2</h2><br>
        <p>The sequel to the critically acclaimed first game, Hades 2 is a refreshingly different game, while still staying true to the style of Hades.
            <br>A new magic casting system, two different routes to explore, and a bunch of new boons, weapons, enemies, and gods, make Hades 2 incredibly addictive.
        <br>While still technically in early access, Hades 2 feels incredibly well polished with very little bugs and extremely impressive art direction and audio.
