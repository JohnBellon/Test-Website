        <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a first year game design and interactive media student at Michigan State University</p>
        <p>I've lived in East Lansing my entire life, so I am incredibly grateful to call myself a spartan!</p>
        <p>I love videogames and art design in games. Some of my favorite games are Bioshock, Terraria, and Hades 1&2.</p>

        <br> <h2>My Favorite Game Right Now!</h2>
        <h3>(February 2025)    Hades II:</h3>
        <img src="hades2.png">
        <p>The sequel to the critically acclaimed first game, Hades 2 is a refreshingly different game, while still staying true to the style of Hades.
            <br>A new magic casting system, two different routes to explore, and a bunch of new boons, weapons, enemies, and gods, make Hades 2 incredibly addictive.
        <br>While still technically in early access, Hades 2 feels incredibly well polished with very little bugs.
             </p> <br>
        <h3>Hades II's Strengths</h3>
             <p> Just like the first game, as can be expected by developer SuperGiant Games, the audio and art design are excellent.<br>
            The voice acting and story are top notch. All of the new introuduced characters are excellent and the returning ones are also cool, with completely new designs.</p>
             <br>
